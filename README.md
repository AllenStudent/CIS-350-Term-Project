**WIP**
## Synopsis
**Studious** is planned to be an android-based student organizational assistant, with primary feature goals being...
1. Calendar/Event-planner to allow students to keep track of their upcoming exams, projects, presentations, and etc. in one place.
2. Ability to keep track of how many work-hours have been committed to a single project/goal.
3. Ability to set weekly goals/to-do lists for work-hours put toward specific projects.
 

This will assist a student in organizing and using their time efficiently through the chaos that is college scheduling.

A possible secondary stretch feature would be a repository for students to upload a certain professor's general assignment scheduling for a specific class. E.G. allowing students to see if their CIS 350 class will have a semester-long group project as opposed to CIS 241 having 4 individual projects throughout the semester.
